Mass Image Download, Resize, and Watermark Script-

This script allows you to download images from a list of URLs, resize them, add a watermark overlay, and save the processed images to an output folder. The script is written in Python and utilizes the requests library for downloading images and the PIL (Python Imaging Library) library for image manipulation.

Prerequisites
Before using this script, make sure you have the following:

Python installed on your system (version 3 or above).
Required Python libraries: requests and Pillow (can be installed via pip).
Getting Started
Download the script to your local machine.
Open the script file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
Usage
The script provides a function called mass_download_resize_watermark that takes the following parameters:

python
Copy code
mass_download_resize_watermark(image_urls, output_folder, size, watermark_path)
image_urls (list): A list of URLs pointing to the images you want to download and process.
output_folder (str): The path to the folder where the processed images will be saved.
size (tuple): A tuple specifying the desired dimensions (width, height) for resizing the images.
watermark_path (str): The path to the watermark image file (PNG format) that will be overlaid on the resized images.
Modify the script according to your needs by providing the appropriate values for the variables image_urls, output_folder, size, and watermark_path.

Note: Ensure that the watermark image is in PNG format and has transparency, as it will be applied as an overlay on the resized images.

Running the Script
To run the script, execute the script file using Python:

bash
Copy code
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the actual name of the script file.

Output
The script will download the images from the provided URLs, resize them according to the specified dimensions, apply the watermark overlay, and save the processed images in the specified output folder. The output filenames will have prefixes to indicate the processing steps performed:

Downloaded images: image_<index>.jpg
Resized images: resized_image_<index>.jpg
Watermarked images: watermarked_image_<index>.jpg
Example
Here's an example usage of the script:

python
Copy code
image_urls = [
    'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/image3.jpg'
]
output_folder = '/path/to/output/folder'
size = (600, 600)
watermark_path = '/path/to/watermark.png'

mass_download_resize_watermark(image_urls, output_folder, size, watermark_path)
Make sure to replace the URLs, output folder path, and watermark path with your own values.
